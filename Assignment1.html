  <h1 class="title">Background</h1>
  <p>
  The beauty of emotion, complexity of behavior and the varying norms of society have always fascinated me on a conscious and subconscious level, particularly being the third child of a very exciting and active household.
</p>

<p>As a Regional Business Development Manager for Suneva Medical, I played a key role as a primary contact for all customers providing effective insight on business strategy, marketing strategy, and customer experience optimization. In this capacity, I exceeded all sales and revenue goals by developing and managing strong relationships with existing accounts while prospecting potential customers to generate new business.
